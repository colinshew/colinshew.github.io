*What makes us human?* Unique cognitive and morphological features distinguish us from our closest living relatives. Humans can communicate with complex language, walk on two feet, and across the planet are adapted to a variety of different diets. Conversely, these adaptations may also have sensitzed humans to conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Ultimately, traits like these have a basis in the genome. My research is focsed on the intersection of two very broad and dynamic topics:
1. **Structural variation:** Large-scale duplications, deletions, and inversions of DNA have long been difficult to detect with short-read sequencing technologies, yet it has become increasingly clear that structural differences represent a large proportion of genetic variation within and between species. Of note, duplications occurring only on the human lineage contain human-specific genes, some of which (such as *SRGAP2C*, *ARHGAP11B*, and *NOTCH2NL*) have demonstrated roles in human brain development.
2. **Gene regulation:** Regulatory control is critical to proper development, and alterations to noncoding sequence underlie many human diseases. In addition, gene regulation is thought to a major driver of evolutionary change, as the spatiotemporal expression of genes can be altered modulalrly, while leaving the coding sequence intact.

Structural variation is likely to alter normal regulatory pathways by reorganizing the genome, and these regulatory changes are often determine the functional changes and evolutionary fates of genes.

The questions driving my research: How has structural variation altered gene regulation in humans compared to other primates? What functional effects has this had on our species?
