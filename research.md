*What makes us human?* Unique cognitive and morphological features distinguish our species from our closest living relatives. We walk on two feet, are adapted to a variety of diets and pathogens, and communicate abstract ideas with complex language. Conversely, some of these adaptations may also have sensitized humans to conditions such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Ultimately, these traits are rooted in the genome. My research sits at the intersection of two broad and dynamic fields:
1. **Structural variation:** Large-scale duplications, deletions, and inversions of DNA are difficult to detect with short-read sequencing, yet structural differences comprise much of genetic variation within and between species. Of note, duplications occurring only on the human lineage contain human-specific genes, some of which (such as *SRGAP2C*, *ARHGAP11B*, and *NOTCH2NL*) have demonstrated roles in human brain development or associations with genomic disease.
2. **Gene regulation:** Regulatory control is critical to proper development, and alterations to noncoding sequence underlie many disease pathologies. In addition, gene regulation is thought to be a major driver of evolutionary change, as spatiotemporal expression patterns can be altered modulalrly, leaving the coding sequence intact.

Structural variation is likely to disrupt normal gene regulation by reorganizing the genome, and these regulatory changes often determine the functional effects of mutations and evolutionary fates of affected genes.

The questions driving my research: How has structural variation altered gene regulation in humans compared to other primates? What functional effects has this had on our health and evolution?
