<p>Welcome to my personal site! Please navigate through the links on the top right.</p>

<p>I'm excited about harnessing the power of sequencing technologies to understand human health and evolution. I'm completing a PhD in human genomics in Megan Dennis' lab at the University of California, Davis, where I study how structural variation shapes gene regulation in human and non-human primate genomes.</p>
